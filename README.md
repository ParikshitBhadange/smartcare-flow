# Welcome to Shela Gang project

## Project summary
Problem: Medicines get overstocked in some hospitals and run out in others due to poor forecasting, manual tracking, and slow redistribution, especially during outbreaks and crises.
​
Solution: A smart logistics platform that forecasts demand, monitors inventory in real time, and optimizes redistribution routes so the right drugs are at the right place and time.
